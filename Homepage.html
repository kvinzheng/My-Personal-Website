     <h2>My Name Is Kevin Zheng</h2>
     <h3>Bio</h3>
     <p>I am Kevin. I am currently attending Galvanize's web development course to become a
       web developer. I am from the Bay Area. The picture above is the golden gate bridge.
       I was born in China, Zhongshan. Zhongshan was a small city in China.
       Zhongshan was a small urban city located in the south of China. I moved
       to U.S. when I was 14. I spent my teenagehood in Pleasanton, CA. I went to
       Foothill High School and UC Davis afterward. I studied Managerial Economics in College.
      I love everything in the U.S. People in my school were friendly, everyone is just so nice to each other.
       I also put an attached picture, where I went to Lake Tahoe with my friends. It was during Christmas and we were playing snow
       there. The snow were pretty cold there but it was very fun.
