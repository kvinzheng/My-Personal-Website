      <ul class="galvanize">
      <li>In November, 2016, I left my job as an business analyst and signed up for Galvanize's 6 months
         web development immersive program. I have been very excited and commited for
         a career change because I like to play code for my career, but I was scared at first.
         I told myself that if I really want to do this, I better work very hard
        .Otherwise, I might live with a huge debt for a while.  </li>
      <li>I have a feeling that this is probably going to be a difficult program.
          One evening in November, I attended a html evening workshop from Galvanize. That evening was the first time I
          learn HTML/CSS and used HTML/CSS to create an simple website. The instructor told me HTML define the content and structure while
           CSS defines the visual style of the webpage.we were actually able to make an website just in two hours.
           I also realized that the people sitting in the classroom ranged from all kind of background.
           It appears to me that the ecosystem wass really friendly and high-tech.
           I was lucky because I was able meet couple instructors before I started this program and really understand
           what I am getting myself into--- a career change and a nonstop learning. I really like everyting here and I can't wait to come here soon!
           So I took a deep breath and enrolled into Galvanize's webdevelopment program.</i>

      <h3 class="after"> What do I want to do after the web development program </h3>
      <img class="web" src="images/webdeveloper.jpg" alt = "webdeveloper">
      <ul>
        <li>My plan after Galvanize would be landing a job either as a front-end developer or back-end developer in the San Francisco bay area. I would like to work in companies
        like Twitter, Accenture, and JP Morgan</li>
        <li>After all, my ultimate goal is to be happy and have a career advancement. That allows me to pay off the loan. Ultimately,
            if I make enough and I would like to travel to Europe and Canada. I haven't have an opportunity to travel since I worked. I really want to take a break
            later after I have secured my first software engineering job. There are still many places in the world that I haven't been to, and I would like to visit those places one day.
